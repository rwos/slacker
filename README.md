A TODO list tracker/viewer. There are many like it, but this
one is mine.

It searches in ~/src for files named `TODO` and `GOAL` and
displays them. That's all it does, currently.

Build and Install
-----------------

You'll need Racket (<http://racket-lang.org/download/>).

    $ make
    $ make install

The default install PREFIX is `/usr`.
